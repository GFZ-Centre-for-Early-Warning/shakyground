    Implements GMPE of Nath et. al (2012) for intraplate margin seismicity in
    the Shillong Plateau of India at 25-45 km deph.

    Verification of mean value data was done by digitizing Figure 11 using
    http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app/. Note that this independent
    verification did not include magnitude dependence or standard deviations.
